# Digital-Images-Processing-in-C-
In this project we are performing some well-defined and well-understood operations on digital images. These operations are inspired from the features available in commonly used image viewing/processing software systems like irfanview, MS-paint etc.

The Features Include:

FILE HANDLING
Open File (initially pgm file will be supported only)
Save File

IMAGE TRANSFORMATIONS
Rotate an Image by a certain angle (theta)
Rotation will be with or without clipping
Rotation will be performed either in the forward or reverse.
Flip an Image

Enhance an image by applying a filter
Some pre-defined filters must be provided
Mean Filter
Median Filter

Combining Two Images to form a new image
 Combine by placing two images side-by-side 
 
 
 Note:
 Download Irfanview software and from there convert image in PGM format before opening it in Program. And even After performing operations on images and saving, open them in irfanview.
